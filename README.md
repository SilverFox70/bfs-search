# Graph BFS Algorithms

In this repo you will find Breadth First Search algorithms for graphs.  The first one is written in javascript and is based on a programming exercise that you can find [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/breadth-first-search/p/challenge-implement-breadth-first-search).

+ A ruby version can be found in <tt>bfs_search.rb</tt>. 
+ There is also a Java solution: the code is viewable in <tt>bfs_search.java</tt> and the compiled files (VertexData.class, VertexList.class, and bfs_search.class) can be downloaded to run locally...provided you have Java 1.8 installed.

Coming soon:

+ Augmentation to the algorithm to return the shortest path
+ Augmentation to return the length of the shortest path
+ possible implementations in C# and Python.
