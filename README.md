# Graph BFS Algorithms

In this repo you will find Breadth First Search algorithms for graphs.  The first one is written in javascript and is based on a programming exercise that you can find [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/breadth-first-search/p/challenge-implement-breadth-first-search)

Coming soon:

+ The same bfs algorithm implemented in Ruby
+ Augmentation to the algorithm to return the shortest path
+ Augmentation to return the length of the shortest path
+ possible implementations in Java, C#, and Python.
